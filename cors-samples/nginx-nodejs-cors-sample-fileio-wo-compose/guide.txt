docker build -t pokemon-frontend .
docker run -d -it -p 80:80 --name frontend pokemon-frontend

docker build -t pokemon-backend .
docker run -d -it -p 8080:8080 --name backend pokemon-backend

---> 	frontend not work correctly because it can not find the 'backend'
	host because they need a network that both of them connect it,
	so we need to create a network and connect the containers by the
	following commands

docker network create multi-host-network
docker network connect multi-host-network frontend
docker network connect multi-host-network backend

--->	then the frontend container can find the 'backend' host on the
	'multi-host-network' and it can be started properly by the following
	command

docker start frontend -a
